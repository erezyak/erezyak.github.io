        <h2>The Holiday of Mardi Gras</h2>
        <img class="paraPic1" src="images/edoardo-maresca-WJXNZEPSues-unsplash.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="p1">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
            Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. <br> In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).
        </p>
        <p class="p1-ext">
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. <br> The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
            Knights
            of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys. <br>
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

        </p>

        <p class="p1-ext">
            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
            French
            Quarter. <br> Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown
            in the
            Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes
            with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

        <h2 class="p2H">History</h2>
        <img class="paraPic2" src="images/flaxofrex.png" alt="">
        <p class="p2">

            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and
            18th
            centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted
            calf,
            followed France to her colonies.

            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
            ground 60
            miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the
            eve of the
            festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In
            1703, the
            tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras. <br>

            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current
            Mardi Gras
            krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
            1861. The
            procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with
            an actual
            bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p class="p2-ext">
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
            Orleans, but not
            with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
            established elegant
            society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p class="p2-ext">
            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing
            body. That
            year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival
            organizations
            formed in New Orleans.
            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
            celebrate Mardi
            Gras.
        </p>
        <p class="p2-ext">
            Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an
            exciting air
            of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John
            Milton's
            hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
            floats (known
            as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.

        <p class="p3">LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of

            The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth
            Night or
            Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event. </p>
